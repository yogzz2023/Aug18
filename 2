Sure, I can help you create a simple menu script that runs the specified scripts based on user input. Here's an example of what the menu script could look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    echo "Menu:"
    echo "1. Run client1.sh"
    echo "2. Run client2.sh"
    echo "3. Run server.sh"
    echo "4. Exit"
    
    read -p "Enter your choice: " choice
    
    case $choice in
        1)
            ./client1.sh
            ;;
        2)
            ./client2.sh
            ;;
        3)
            ./server.sh
            ;;
        4)
            echo "Exiting menu."
            exit 0
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid choice. Please select a valid option."
            ;;
    esac
done
```

Save this script in a file named `menu.sh` in the same directory as your other scripts (`client1.sh`, `client2.sh`, `server.sh`). Make sure the scripts have execute permissions (you can use `chmod +x scriptname.sh` to give execute permissions).

When you run `menu.sh`, it will display a menu with options to run the respective scripts. Just enter the number corresponding to the script you want to run. If you want to exit the menu, choose option 4.

Remember to replace `./client1.sh`, `./client2.sh`, and `./server.sh` with the actual paths to your script files.

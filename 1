Certainly! Here's a more efficient version of the menu script that avoids the repetition of code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

scripts=("client1.sh" "client2.sh" "server.sh")

while true; do
    echo "Menu:"
    for i in "${!scripts[@]}"; do
        echo "$((i+1)). Run ${scripts[i]}"
    done
    echo "$(( ${#scripts[@]} + 1 )). Exit"
    
    read -p "Enter your choice: " choice
    
    if (( choice >= 1 && choice <= ${#scripts[@]} )); then
        ./"${scripts[choice-1]}"
    elif (( choice == ${#scripts[@]} + 1 )); then
        echo "Exiting menu."
        exit 0
    else
        echo "Invalid choice. Please select a valid option."
    fi
done
```

This version uses an array called `scripts` to hold the script names. It then loops through the array to display the menu options dynamically. When a choice is made, it checks if the choice is within the valid range of options and then executes the corresponding script. The exit option is also handled more elegantly.

Again, save this script in a file named `menu.sh` and make sure the execute permissions are set. Replace `"client1.sh"`, `"client2.sh"`, and `"server.sh"` with the actual script names if they are located in the same directory.
